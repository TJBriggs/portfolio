# Lu by Lucid Agency
# Version 1.0.0

Meet Lu -- a minimal, but modern WordPress starter theme. Lu is a customized version of the <a href="https://roots.io/sage/" target="_blank">Sage</a> theme which was created by the awesome folks at Roots. Lu utilizes all the great features of Sage like modern security, advanced workflows, template inheritance, and Bootstrap's grid system, but its enhanced file structure creates a modular framework that is easy to update and maintain.
